## Motivation

[Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) are awesome. For most use cases, they are more than good enough. But there are some cases which have a few limitations, by design, and in the increasingly creative landscape of deep learning it would be nice to have a framework which addresses these limitations. So this project will build on the really great stuff that both of those frameworks offer while providing greater flexibility. In particular, this project focuses on:

1. Alternative RNN structures
2. Move away from supervised learning
3. Easier weight sharing
