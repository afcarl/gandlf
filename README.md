## Generative Adversarial Network Deep Learning Framework

>He that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.
>(Tim Peters, Council of Elrond Style Guide)

This is a framework built on top of [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) for training [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).

Some guiding principles, in no particular order:

 - *Keras-esque*: The APIs should feel familiar for Keras users, with some minor changes.
 - *Powerful*: Models should support a wide variety of GAN architectures.
 - *Extensible*: Models should be easy to modify for different experiments.

## Issues Etiquette

If you encounter an error, I would really like to hear about it! But please raise an issue before creating a pull request, to discuss the error. There a number of resources available for discussion; here is a list, again in no particular order:
