[mnist_rnn_gan.py](https://github.com/codekansas/gandlf/blob/master/examples/mnist_rnn_gan.py)

This example illustrates:

 - Using RNNs in your GAN architecture
 - Using attention components to direct GAN learning (with the recurrent attention wrappers, `gandlf.layers.RecurrentAttention1D` and `gandlf.layers.RecurrentAttention2D`)
