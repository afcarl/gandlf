This is an implementation of the [neural-enhance](https://github.com/alexjc/neural-enhance) project. The model can be trained on MNIST or CIFAR data. The MNIST digits below illustrate the model. The first two digits the "real" data, where the first is a downsampled version of the second. The remaining digits are the results of iteratively applying the model, upsampling the original digit.

The same process can be done on CIFAR images:
